Tip Calculator
==============

See working implementation at http://cse460.the.tl

Tip Calculator implemented with
object oriented coffeescript

the main files are

* `Controller.coffee`
* `View.coffee`
* `Tip.coffee` (for the model)
* `Guest.coffee` another Model


These files were compiled to JavaScript to run in a web browser

I am using a Model View Controller design pattern.
Everything else is straigt forward.
